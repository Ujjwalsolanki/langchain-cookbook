      "Quiz Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Q: What is the main goal of Linear Regression?**\n",
      "   A: The main goal of Linear Regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Q: Name two advantages of Linear Regression.**\n",
      "   A: Two advantages of Linear Regression are its simplicity and interpretability, and its computational efficiency, especially on large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Q: How does Linear Regression handle outliers?**\n",
      "   A: Linear Regression is sensitive to outliers, which can significantly impact the regression line and overall model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Q: What is the homoscedasticity assumption in Linear Regression?**\n",
      "   A: The homoscedasticity assumption is that the variance of errors remains constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Q: What challenge does multicollinearity present in Linear Regression?**\n",
      "   A: Multicollinearity, or high correlation between independent variables, makes coefficient interpretation difficult and can lead to unstable models.\n",
