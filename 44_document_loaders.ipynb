    "# Document Loaders in LangChain üìö\n",
    "\n",
    "Document loaders are essential components in LangChain, particularly for building **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** based Large Language Model (LLM) applications. They serve the crucial purpose of ingesting various types of documents into a standardized format that LangChain applications can readily process.\n",

    "## What are Document Loaders? üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, document loaders are tools designed to load data from diverse sources into **Document objects**. A Document object typically contains:\n",
    "* `page_content`: The actual text content of the document.\n",
    "* `metadata`: A dictionary holding additional information about the document, such as its source, page number, or any other relevant attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured format allows LangChain to consistently handle data regardless of its origin, making it easier to integrate with other components like text splitters, embeddings, and LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Document Sources üìÇ\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides a wide array of built-in document loaders to handle data from numerous sources, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text files**: Simple `.txt` files.\n",
    "* **PDFs**: Portable Document Format files.\n",
    "* **Web pages**: Content from URLs.\n",
    "* **Databases**: Data from various database systems.\n",
    "* **Cloud storage services**: Files stored on platforms like S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these loaders, especially those for community-contributed integrations, are found within the `langchain_community` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom Document Loaders ‚úçÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "If a specific data source doesn't have an existing LangChain document loader, you have the flexibility to create your own custom loader. This is achieved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Inheriting from the `BaseLoader` class.\n",
    "2.  Implementing the `lazy_load()` and `load()` methods, which define how your custom loader will read and process the documents from your unique source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This extensibility ensures that LangChain can adapt to virtually any data ingestion requirement.\n",
