    "LangChain's `with_structured_output()` method is a powerful helper function that streamlines getting structured data from LLMs. It works by leveraging the underlying model's capabilities to enforce a specific output format. The two primary \"modes\" it uses, especially with OpenAI models, are **JSON mode** and **Function/Tool Calling mode**.\n",

    "## `with_structured_output()` Overview ‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "This method automatically handles the process of instructing the LLM to return data in a specific schema (e.g., a Pydantic model or a raw JSON Schema) and then parsing that output into a usable Python object. You pass your desired schema to `with_structured_output()`, and it returns a new \"runnable\" LLM that will attempt to produce output matching that schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between JSON mode and Function mode lies in *how* the LLM is instructed and *what* it's inherently designed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON Mode üìÑ\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it is\n",
    "**JSON mode** is a feature available in some LLMs (like specific OpenAI models such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and certain `gpt-3.5-turbo` versions). When enabled, it strictly enforces that the LLM's entire response content will be a **valid JSON object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "1.  **Instruction**: When you use `with_structured_output(schema, method=\"json_mode\")` in LangChain (or set `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` directly in the OpenAI API), LangChain tells the LLM: \"Your entire output *must* be a JSON object.\"\n",
    "2.  **Schema Guidance (Soft)**: While JSON mode guarantees *valid JSON*, it doesn't inherently guarantee that the JSON will conform to a *specific schema* (like your `Review` Pydantic model). You still typically include instructions in your prompt (e.g., in a system message) detailing the desired JSON structure. The LLM will try its best to follow these instructions to fill the JSON.\n",
    "3.  **Parsing**: LangChain then takes the guaranteed valid JSON string from the LLM's response and attempts to parse it into the Python object (e.g., Pydantic model or dictionary) you defined in your schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use it\n",
    "* When you need a **guaranteed valid JSON output**, but strict schema adherence isn't the absolute highest priority, or when your schema is relatively simple.\n",
    "* For models that *only* support JSON mode (and not native function calling for your specific schema).\n",
    "* For general structured output where the LLM just needs to \"fill in the blanks\" of a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function/Tool Calling Mode üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it is\n",
    "**Function/Tool Calling mode** (often just \"Function Calling\" for simplicity) is a more advanced capability in larger, more capable LLMs (like `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, and certain `gpt-3.5-turbo` versions). Instead of just generating text, these models are trained to detect when a user's intent can be fulfilled by calling a *tool* or *function*, and then respond with a JSON object specifying the function name and its arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "1.  **Schema as Tool Description**: When you use `with_structured_output(schema)` (without `method=\"json_mode\"`) for a model that supports function calling, LangChain converts your Pydantic model or JSON Schema into a \"tool definition\" (a JSON Schema description of a function).\n",
    "2.  **LLM \"Decides\" to Call**: This tool definition is then provided to the LLM. The LLM processes your input and, based on its training, \"decides\" if it needs to \"call\" this defined tool to fulfill your request. If it decides to call, it generates a response that is a JSON object formatted as a \"tool call,\" including the name of the tool and the arguments (extracted data) that match your schema.\n",
    "3.  **Strict Schema Adherence**: This is where Function Calling excels. Because the model is specifically trained to map natural language to structured function arguments based on the provided schema, it's highly effective at generating **schema-compliant JSON**. It's not just generating *any* JSON; it's generating JSON that perfectly fits the \"function's\" expected input.\n",
    "4.  **Parsing**: LangChain receives this tool call JSON, extracts the arguments, and then parses them into your desired Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use it\n",
    "* When you need **guaranteed schema adherence** and highly reliable extraction of structured data.\n",
    "* For models that support this advanced capability (typically larger, more recent models).\n",
    "* When you're essentially asking the LLM to \"fill out a form\" or \"extract specific entities\" that directly map to your defined schema.\n",
    "* It's the recommended approach when available, as it generally leads to more robust and accurate structured outputs.\n",
