    "# Text Splitters in LangChain ‚úÇÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "Text splitters are fundamental components in LangChain, especially vital for building robust **Generative AI applications** and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM applications**. Their primary role is to break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",

    "## Why is Text Splitting Necessary? ü§î\n",
    "\n",
    "Text splitting addresses several critical challenges when working with large volumes of text and Language Models (LLMs):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overcoming LLM Input Limitations**: LLMs and embedding models often have **context length constraints**. Large documents exceed these limits, making it impossible to feed the entire content to the model at once. Text splitting allows you to process documents of virtually any size by breaking them into pieces that fit within these constraints.\n",
    "* **Improving Output Quality**: By providing LLMs with smaller, more focused chunks of text, the model can concentrate on relevant information, leading to more accurate, coherent, and higher-quality outputs.\n",
    "* **Efficient Processing**: Smaller chunks are generally faster to process, contributing to more efficient and responsive applications.\n",

    "## Types of Text Splitters üß©\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain offers various strategies for splitting text, each with its own advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recursive Character Text Splitter**: This is highlighted as one of the **most effective and commonly used text splitters** It attempts to split text recursively by a list of characters, trying to keep paragraphs and sentences together as long as possible.\n",
    "* **Contextual Text Splitting**: While promising, the video notes that this method, which aims to split text based on semantic context, may not always yield satisfying results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and effectively utilizing text splitters is a key step in developing sophisticated RAG-based applications."
